Competition}\label{applying-probabilistic-classification-models-to-a-machine-learning-competition}}

\hypertarget{problem-introduction}{%
\subsection{Problem Introduction}\label{problem-introduction}}

\href{https://numer.ai/learn}{Numerai} is a hedge fund that trades based
on the results of weekly machine learning competitions. This strategy
relies on the wisdom of the crowd and the democratization of machine
learning to create a viable trading platform. Every week, Numerai
releases a new set of training and testing data to the public and the
best performing model predictions (as measured on a validation set) are
selected to be used in live stock market trading. Contributors have the
chance to earn a cryptocurrency,
\href{https://numer.ai/whitepaper.pdf}{Numeraire} for their predictions
based on performance in the market. The competitions run by Numerai are
set apart from other machine learning competitions in that competitors
must place a stake on their predictions representing confidence that
their model can generalize to new data. In theory, this should reduce
the common problem of overfitting in machine learning competitions where
models are highly tuned to maximize scores on the test set.

\hypertarget{project-objectives}{%
\section{Project Objectives}\label{project-objectives}}

My project will apply Probabilistic Classification methods to the
Numerai weekly machine learning compeitions. Most winners of these
competitions use standard models such as Logistic Regression, Gradient
Boosted Classifiers, or Deep Neural Networks. However, based on the
discussions I have read, there is little, if any, use of probabilistic
programming methods. I intend to use
\href{https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/GP-slice-sampling.html}{Gaussian
Process Classification in PyMC3} to make predictions and submit them to
one or several weekly competitions. I also want to examine using
\href{https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/bayesian_neural_network_advi.html}{Bayesian
Neural Networks in PyMC3} for classification. The competitions run every
week, which will give me several attempts to experiment with different
models. I have had some limited success using standard methods and want
to see if there may be some advantage to using probabilistic models for
classification. The plan for this project is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Develop several standard machine learning classification models as a
  baseline
\item
  Develop probabilistic classification models using PyMC3
\item
  Submit predictions to Numerai weekly competitions and compare
\item
  Iterate on models to see if Probabilistic Models can be competitive
  with standard machine learning models
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

The competitions are a supervised classification task: the datasets
contains features corresponding to market indicators and binary labels
corresponding to buy/sell choices. Every week, Numerai releases a new
set of training and testing data for a new competition. The data is
completely de-identified which means the features can not be linked back
to real-world indicators. The training dataset contains several hundred
thousand observations, each with a corresponding binary target. For the
testing set, there are three separate tags:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Validation: contains actual labels which can be used by competitors to
  evaluate their model
\item
  Test: used to determine the leaderboard on Numer.ai. Labels are not
  provided for these samples.
\item
  Live: predictions made on these samples are used live in the stock
  market. No labels are provided (as they are not available) for these
  samples.
\end{enumerate}

Predictions submitted by competitors are to be made in the form of a
decimal between 0 and 1 rather than 0/1. Competitors are ranked on a
leaderboard based on the test scores and are paid based on how much they
stake and performance on the live predictions which are used in actual
trading by Numerai.

\hypertarget{metrics}{%
\subsubsection{Metrics}\label{metrics}}

The primary metric for evaluating the performance of a model is
log-loss. Predictions are ranked on the leaderboard in terms of log-loss
on the test set.

However, in addition to log-loss, to be considered on the leaderboard,
the model must meet the following 3 criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Consistency: The percentage of eras (an defined grouping of samples)
  in which a model has a log loss \textless{} - ln(0.5). A model must
  achieve greater than 75\% consistency to make it on the leaderboard.
\item
  Originality: A measure of the correlation of predictions with
  previously submitted predictions from other users. This is to
  encourage novel models but also has the side effect of favoring
  earlier submissions.
\item
  Concordance: A measure of if predictions made on the validation, test,
  and live data set are from the same model. Predictions should be from
  one model to prevent overfitting to the validation data.
\end{enumerate}
